## Revolutionizing Web3 Infrastructure
The rise of blockchain technology has ushered in a new era of Internet infrastructure, where decentralized applications are proliferating rapidly. However, blockchain adoption faces several challenges, including frequent outages, high costs, low throughput, and security concerns. To make blockchain technology truly accessible in the web3 era, it needs to evolve into a trusted, scalable, cost-effective, and continuously improving platform for widespread application development.

## Introduction 
In the web2 Internet, centralized companies like Google, Amazon, Apple, and Meta provide various services, controlling direct access to user data. They deploy application-specific software on cloud infrastructure, making it relatively easy to scale to billions of users. However, this centralized trust model has raised concerns.

Web3 aims to address these concerns by introducing blockchain technology. Blockchains offer decentralized and immutable ledgers that enable secure interactions without relying on intermediaries. Just as cloud infrastructure empowered web2 services, blockchains can serve as a decentralized infrastructure layer for web3 applications. Yet, despite numerous blockchains, web3 adoption remains limited due to issues like reliability, high transaction fees, low throughput, security vulnerabilities, and slow responsiveness.

## The Aptos Vision
The Aptos blockchain emerges as a solution to these challenges, with a vision to drive mainstream adoption of web3 and empower decentralized applications to solve real-world problems. Aptos focuses on enhancing blockchain reliability, safety, and performance through a flexible and modular architecture.

### Key Principles

#### Security:
Aptos natively integrates the Move language for secure transaction execution. The Move prover, a formal verifier, adds extra layers of security to smart contracts, safeguarding against malicious actors.

#### User Trust: 
Aptos offers a flexible data model, robust key management, and hybrid custodial options. This, along with transparent transactions and efficient light client protocols, ensures a safer and more trustworthy user experience.

#### Throughput and Efficiency:
Aptos achieves high throughput and low latency through a pipelined and modular approach to transaction processing. It optimally utilizes physical resources, improving hardware efficiency.

#### Atomicity:
Unlike other parallel execution engines, Aptos supports atomicity for complex transactions without upfront data knowledge, enhancing throughput and latency for real-world applications.

#### Modular Architecture: 
Aptos facilitates frequent upgrades and supports new technology innovations, thanks to its modular design and on-chain change management protocols.

#### Scalability: 
Aptos explores internal sharding of validators and homogeneous state sharding, potentially achieving horizontal throughput scalability without adding complexity for node operators.


## Overview
The Aptos blockchain is a robust infrastructure designed to support safe, fast, reliable, and upgradable web3 applications. It consists of a network of validators utilizing a byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT), proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Token holders stake tokens in validators, and each validator's consensus weight corresponds to its staked amount. Validators can be active participants in consensus or temporarily inactive for various reasons.

Clients interact with the blockchain, submitting transactions or querying its state and history. Full nodes replicate the blockchain's state, while light clients maintain minimal data and validators' sets. Wallets are a common example of light clients.

### The Aptos blockchain is guided by the following core design principles:

1. #### Fast and Secure Execution: 
It employs the Move programming language for secure smart contract execution, emphasizing auditability and mechanical analyzability.

2. #### High Throughput and Low Latency: 
Transaction processing utilizes a batched, pipelined, and parallelized approach to achieve exceptional throughput and low latency.

3. #### Atomic Transaction Processing: 
Aptos employs Block-STM to efficiently support atomicity for complex transactions without the need for upfront data knowledge.

4. #### Performance and Decentralization Optimizations: 
Rapid validator set rotation and reputation tracking enhance both performance and decentralization.

5. #### Upgradeability and Configurability: 
These principles support new use cases and the latest technology advancements.

6. #### Modular Designs: 
Component-level testing, threat modeling, and seamless deployment ensure secure and reliable operations.

7. #### Horizontal Throughput Scalability: 
Sharding is a core concept exposed to users and embedded in the programming and data model.


## The Move Language
Move is a smart contract programming language prioritizing safety and flexibility. Aptos uses Move's object model to represent ledger state and Move code (modules) to encode state transition rules. Users submit transactions to publish or upgrade modules, execute entry functions, or interact with module interfaces.

The Move ecosystem includes a compiler, a virtual machine, and developer tools. Inspired by Rust], Move emphasizes data ownership, resource scarcity, preservation, and access control. Modules define resource properties, ensuring resources like tokens are not created without proper credentials and cannot be double-spent or disappear.

Move leverages a bytecode verifier to ensure type and memory safety even with untrusted code. It includes the Move Prover for formal verification, confirming the functional correctness of Move programs against given specifications.

The ledger state also contains the blockchain's configuration, including active validators and staking properties. Move's module upgradeability and programmability enable seamless configuration changes and support Aptos blockchain upgrades with zero downtime.

Aptos enhances Move to support web3 use cases, offering fine-grained resource control, near-fixed data access costs, table support for large datasets, and shared autonomous accounts for complex decentralized organizations.

In the following sections, we delve into Move's role in the Aptos blockchain, the logical data model, security measures, and performance enhancements.
